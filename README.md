# odin-recipes
The current project, Odin Recipes, is a basic website built using HTML. The goal of this project is to create a simple recipe website that links multiple pages together. Each page contains a recipe with ingredients, instructions, and images, all structured using proper HTML elements.

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my understanding of fundamental web development concepts, including:

Creating a basic HTML boilerplate

Structuring content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and links

Linking multiple pages together

Organizing files and directories properly

Using Git for version control and project management

This project reinforces core HTML skills and lays the foundation for more advanced web development concepts.
